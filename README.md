# Airbnb Prediction Kaggle Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Kaggle project focused on predicting key metrics for Airbnb listings using machine learning. The goal of this project was to preprocess the data extensively, engineer useful features, and apply advanced ensemble models to achieve high predictive accuracy.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`Data Processing and Modeling Airbnb.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the end-to-end workflow for the project, including:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, performing sentiment analysis, and creating dummy features.
   - **Data Visualization**: Generating insightful plots to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
   - **Model Training**: Implementing an ensemble of XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest for robust predictions.

2. **`Project Report.pdf`**: A comprehensive report documenting the steps, methodology, and results of the project. This includes the rationale for preprocessing techniques, modeling decisions, and the evaluation of results.

3. **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting insights from text-based features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of dummy variables and other useful features to enhance model performance.
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combining predictions from XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest to optimize predictive accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Clear and insightful visualizations to guide data understanding and decision-making.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost catboost lightgbm
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Data Processing and Modeling Airbnb.ipynb"
   ```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, visualize insights, and train models.

## Results
The ensemble approach leveraged the strengths of different models, achieving competitive performance on the Kaggle leaderboard. Detailed metrics and insights are included in the `Project Report.pdf`.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Kaggle for providing the dataset and to the open-source community for tools and libraries that made this project possible.
